      <h1>About Captain's Blog</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Hello! Welcome to Captain's Blog, your go-to source for insightful
        articles on aviation, programming, and drumming. My name is Captain
        Bett, and Iâ€™m thrilled to share my knowledge and experiences with you.
        Each of these interests has shaped who I am and how I see the world.
        Here's a little more about each of them:
      </p>

      <h2>Aviation</h2>
      <p>
        Ever since I was a child, I've been fascinated by the skies. The
        mechanics of flight, the thrill of takeoff, and the serene beauty of
        cruising at altitude all captivate me. I spend a lot of time reading
        about aviation technology, aircraft design, and flight simulation.
        Whenever I get the chance, I visit airshows and aviation museums to
        learn more and see these incredible machines up close. I have intentions
        of venturing more into this mind-blowing field in the near future.
      </p>

      <h2>Programming</h2>
      <p>
        Programming is not just a profession for me; it's a passion. I enjoy
        creating software that solves problems and makes life easier. I have
        experience in programming languages such as Python and JavaScript. I
        love staying up-to-date with the latest trends in technology and
        continuously improving my skills. Whether it's developing web
        applications, automating tasks, or experimenting with new frameworks,
        programming always keeps me engaged and challenged.
      </p>

      <h2>Drumming</h2>
      <p>
        Drumming is my creative outlet. There's something incredibly satisfying
        about creating rhythms and beats. I enjoy playing different styles, from
        sebene and jazz to electronic and experimental. Drumming helps me relax
        and express myself in ways that words often can't. I also like
        collaborating with other musicians and exploring how different
        instruments can come together to create unique sounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not coding or flying, you can find me exploring the outdoors,
        trying out new recipes, or indulging in a good sci-fi movie. I believe
        in the power of continuous learning and always strive to stay curious
        and creative.
